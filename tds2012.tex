After scraping data for all passing TDs in 2012, we get the following histogram for number of TD passes by team.

%% begin.rcode cache=TRUE
% scrape <- read.csv('scrape.csv')
% raw_data <- scrape[scrape[,"X"]!="",]
% tds_for_passers <- transform(raw_data[c("Tm","TD")], TD = as.numeric(as.character(TD)))
% tds_for_teams <- aggregate(tds_for_passers$TD, by=list(Team=tds_for_passers$Tm), FUN=sum)
% hist(tds_for_teams$x)
%% end.rcode

The teams with the greatest and least TDs:

%% begin.rcode
% low_high <- c(which.min(tds_for_teams$x), which.max(tds_for_teams$x))
% tds_for_teams[low_high,"Team"]
%% end.rcode

\end{document}
